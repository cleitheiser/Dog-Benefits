            <h2 id=titlerespon>Responsibility</h2>
            <p id="paragraphrespon">As we grow older—especially after we retire—it can be difficult to find structure and meaning day in and day out. Dogs take care of that. “They force people to continue to do things,” says Kristi Littrell, Adoption Manager at Best Friends Animal Society in Utah.</p>

        <div class="section" id="security">
            <h2 id="titlesec">Home Security</h2>
            <p id="paragraphsec">A dogs great hearing can help alert homeowners of suspicious activities, and barking may actually deter burglars from entering a home with a dog. They are also fiercely loyal and won’t think twice about defending their human/s.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section" id="heart">
            <h2 id="titleheart">Heart Health</h2>
            <p id="paragraphheart">Dogs don’t just fill your heart; they actually make it stronger. Studies show that having a canine companion is linked to lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol, and decreased triglyceride levels, which contribute to better overall cardiovascular health and fewer heart attacks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section" id="mental">
            <h2 id="titlemental">Mental Health</h2>
            <p id="paragraphmental">Dogs especially are great at encouraging owners to exercise, and this can be beneficial for those suffering from depression. Pets can also have calming effects on their owner. Just by stroking, sitting next to or playing with a pet can gives owning a chance to relax and calm their minds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section" id="physical">
            <h2 id="titlephysical">Physical Health</h2>
            <p id="paragraphphysical">A study in the journal Gerontologist found that older adults who walked dogs experienced “lower body mass index, fewer activities of daily living limitations, fewer doctor visits, and more frequent moderate and vigorous exercise.”</p>
